/* cfuthread_queue provides a way to serialize requests for a
 * resource where you want the resource to be accessed from a
 * single thread only.  For instance, for a database connection
 * where making calls in separate threads does not work properly,
 * you can use cfuthread_queue.  cfuthread_queue_new() creates a
 * new thread that waits for something to be added to the queue.
 * Once something is added, the thread will process the data by
 * calling the function you pass as an argument to the
 * cfuthread_queue_new() function.
