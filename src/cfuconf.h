/* Apache-style conf files contain directives and containers.
   Directives are simple one line specifications with or without
   arguments, e.g.,

	   Doit
	   Expires On
	   LoadModule my_mod modules/my_mod.so

   Containers have a type and a name associated with them and they
   in turn contain directives and/or containers, e.g.,

	   <MyContainer test1>
		   Expires Off
		   <DB devdb>
			   DBHost db.example.com
			   DBUser test_user
		   </DB>
	   </MyContainer>

   Values may be quoted, e.g.

	   DBUser "test user"

   But must be specified on a single line.  To escape quotes
   within a quoted string, use the '\' character.
